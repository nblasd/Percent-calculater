🚀 Percent-calculater

Welcome! This is an application I've been working on. I wanted to create something that was both functional and easy to deploy.

Getting Started on Your Machine
If you want to take a look under the hood or run a local copy of this app, I've kept the setup process pretty straightforward.

What You'll Need
Before diving in, just make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer.

Setup Steps
Install the essentials: Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

Bash

npm install
This will grab all the necessary packages I used to build the app.

Add your secret sauce (API Key): You’ll need your own Gemini API key for the AI to work. Find the .env.local file in the directory and set the GEMINI_API_KEY variable to your personal key.

Fire it up: Once that's done, you're ready to go! Start the development server with:

Bash

npm run dev
After running that, the app should be live in your browser. Feel free to poke around and see how it works!
